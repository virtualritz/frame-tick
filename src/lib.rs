//! Fixed-point representation of time where each second is divided into
//! 3,603,600 `Tick`s (or 25,200, if the `cargo` feature `low_res` is set).
//!
//! This crate was inspired by [this article](https://iquilezles.org/articles/ticks/)
//! from [Inigo Quilez](https://iquilezles.org/). Please refer to this for a
//! more detailed explanation.
//! > *Note that the default for `TICKS_PER_SECOND`, 3,603,600, is the Least
//! > Common Multiple of all numbers in the list given in the article as well as
//! > 11 and 13, which are needed for NTSC.*
//!
//! This makes is 'compatible' with lots of frame- and refresh rates without
//! ever mapping outside of or repeating a frame. That is: without strobing.
//!
//! In particular, a `Tick` can represent exactly:
//!
//! * 24hz and 48hz, great for movie playback.
//!
//! * 6hz, 8hz and 12hz, great for animating on 4s, 3s and 2s.
//!
//! * 29.97hz, 59.94hz NTSC found in Japan, South Korea and the USA.
//!
//! * 30hz, 60hz, for internet video and TV in the USA.
//!
//! * 25hz and 50hz, for TV in the EU.
//!
//! * 72hz, for Oculus Quest 1.
//!
//! * 90hz for Quest 2, Rift and other headsets.
//!
//! * 120hz, 144hz and 240hz, for newer VR headesets and high frequency
//!   monitors.
//!
//! * And many more.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! # use core::num::NonZeroU32;
//! use tick::{FrameRateConversion, Tick};
//!
//! let tick = Tick::from_secs(1.0);
//!
//! /// A round trip is lossless.
//! assert_eq!(1.0, tick.to_secs());
//! /// One second at 120hz == frame â„– 120.
//! assert_eq!(120, tick.to_frame(NonZeroU32::new(120).unwrap()));
//! ```
